    "welcome-3": "On this web-page you can compare scenarios and change assumptions. All the scenarios reach carbon neutrality before 2050, but technology choice, fuel consumption and cost will change when changing assumptions about readiness of technologies and whether the countries can import biomass and bio-fuels.",
    "welcome-4": "The model used for calculating the scenarios is called Open Nordic TIMES model (ON-TIMES), as with all modelling results - be critical to what you see, do not just accept it. The many combinations of scenarios represented in this viewer indicate the uncertainty of how the future Nordic energy system will develop, but also illustrate which solutions compete and which have synergies",
