# Nordic historical data

The Nordic Energy Statistics Database aims to harmonise energy related data across all five Nordic countries for easy use as a reference for research as well as for the public to explore. Previously there was no common aggregation of Nordic energy statistics and model input. All Nordic countries would need to rely on assumptions about their neighbouring Nordic countriesâ€™ energy systems.
From these data variables progress indicators have been calculated:
- Share of RE in electricity consumption
- CO2 emissions (Mt CO2) from power and district heating
- Share of bioenergy from gross RE consumption
- Battery and plug-in hybrid electric vehicles share of total passenger vehicle stock
- District heat generation (PJ) by fuel
- CO2 emissions (Mt CO2) from the industrial sector
- Final energy consumption by source (PJ) in industry
- Energy intensity (kWh/m2) and CO2 emissions intensity (kgCO2/m2) in the buildings sector 
- CO2 emissions (Mt CO2) from road transport

You can review these indicators under the [Historical Data tab][./tab9].
