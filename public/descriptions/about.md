# NCES2020 - Nordic Clean Energy Scenarios 2020

“The Nordic countries have a unique and long-standing cooperation on energy, which
has created a solid foundation for a sustainable and secure energy supply in the
region. Now, it is time to further Nordic energy cooperation with the green transition
as a new framework.
When the Nordic Prime ministers signed the joint Declaration on Nordic Carbon
Neutrality in January 2019 – committing themselves to working towards carbon
neutrality – Nordic Energy Research recognised the need for a publicly-available
research-based analysis, to gather Nordic perspectives on national and regional
energy systems, and complement the ongoing work in each country.
Nordic Clean Energy Scenarios aim to identify and help prioritise – through scenario
modelling – the necessary actions up to 2030 and map potential long-term
pathways to carbon neutrality, and thereby support the joint Declaration on Carbon
Neutrality. This work is both timely and important, considering tha
This project guides you through the Nordic energy system and illustrates how the
Nordic countries can achieve the Nordic Vision 2030 to become the most sustainable
and integrated region in the world, and make the green transition towards carbon
neutrality a reality.”
