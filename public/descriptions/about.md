# NCES2020 - Nordic Clean Energy Scenarios 2020

The project Nordic Clean Energy Scenarios will identify technological solutions to a carbon neutral Nordic region and develop energy scenarios for the Nordic energy sector that will enable the Nordic prime ministers’ commitment of reaching carbon neutrality.

On January 25, 2019, the prime ministers of the Nordic countries signed the Declaration on Nordic Carbon Neutrality in which they commit themselves to working towards becoming a carbon neutral region. The Nordic Clean Energy Scenarios project supports this effort by modelling a range of alternative carbon neutral scenarios for the Nordic countries individually and as a region.
