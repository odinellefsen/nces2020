# The Meaning of Carbon Neutrality in the Nordic Countries

The adopted definition of carbon neutrality by this project sets the limit for total emissions without defining or prioritizing specific measures in certain sectors.

The differences between countries arise in target years for reaching climate neutrality, in their mid-term targets, and in the use of carbon offsets. Climate neutrality target years range from 2030, Norway, to 2050, Denmark. The difference in target years cannot be directly compared as some countries allow the use of carbon offsets and some will benefit from considerable forest carbon sinks as Sweden.

All scenarios presented on this homepage fulfil the countries individual climate targets. There is no &quot;Reference&quot; scenario or &quot; business as usual&quot;, so with the scenarios in the NCES2020 project we explore possible pathways fulfilling the targets of the Nordic Governments.

The scenarios are constructed around three storylines supplemented with sensitivity variances on the most important assumptions. The storylines are called Carbon Neutral Nordic (CNN), Nordic PowerHouse (NPH) and Climate Neutral Behaviour (CNB). 

The total Nordic GHG reduction trajectory constraining the scenarios are shown in the figure below and it is the energy related CO<sub>2</sub> we include in the modelling. So it is the grey line the ON-TIMES model have to respect.

Because of difference in national targets and impact from LULUCF the profiles are different from country to country:

## Carbon Neutral Nordic (CNN)
Carbon Neutral Nordic (CNN) is the central storyline. It develops according to the Nordic countriesâ€™ national plans, strategies, and targets to reach carbon neutrality. This storyline will not produce a business as usual scenario but rather show what effects stated, but not yet implemented, strategies and targets could achieve. Decarbonization of energy consumption will require fast actions in all sectors. The amount of renewable power and heat production must increase to provide clean energy to end-use sectors. Nordic countries will increase electricity exports to Central Europe, but the amount will not increase much above current projections as electrification of Nordic heating, transport, and industry will require a large supply of low carbon electricity. Biomass imports from outside the Nordics will be limited to current or slightly higher levels to ensure sustainability of bioenergy use. BECCS will compensate some of the most expensive CO<sub>2</sub> emissions abatement options. Onshore wind development will be limited below the technical potential due to acceptability and land use issues.

## Nordic Powerhouse (NPH)
Nordic powerhouse (NPH) is a storyline where the Nordic countries can provide cheaper clean energy than Central Europe and manage to host more low carbon services and industries and increase their exports of low carbon products and energy carriers. In addition to their efforts to reduce Nordic emissions, the Nordic countries host larger number of data centres, produce more batteries, and manage to increase the exports of electricity, electro fuels, and carbon free steel and aluminium. All these activities increase demand for electricity and/or other energy products. The additional electricity and electrofuels would be produced by offshore wind hubs, continuing the lifetime of nuclear power plants, ground-based PV power plants, and by onshore wind, assuming high acceptance for onshore wind. There would be more excess heat from industry and services that can be used in district heating generation. The Nordic economy would benefit from the export of new products, but a macro-economic model to study effects of increasing economic activity is not a part of the NCES project.
 
## Climate Neutral Behaviour (CNB)
Climate Neutral Behaviour (CNB) is a storyline motivated by strong political and citizen engagement, and a rapid decrease in costs of distributed energy generation and other low carbon technologies. In this storyline, politicians and citizens adopt additional energy and material efficiency measures in all sectors that lead to lower energy demand. In addition, decentralized generation technologies become much more common and they further cut the energy delivered through grids and lead to prosumers and districts as energy suppliers. Energy demand for transport decrease due to modal changes, remote working, car sharing, and lower and more efficient heavy transport of goods. Focus of society in this storyline is not on GDP but on sustainability, circular economy, and securing biodiversity.

## Sensitivity Factors
On this homepage you can chose a scenario storyline and look at detailed modelling results on sectors level. But as future is uncertain and the technical details in the model only as good as we can predict today, it is important to show the impact of changing some of the central assumptions, the one that really makes a difference to the results. These sensitivities can be turned on and off for each of the storylines and they can be combined as well.

### Carbon Capture and Storage - icon: barrel
Without negative emissions the targets of the Nordic countries cannot be reached. But one critical part of the carbon capture and storage solutions are the storage. Where to store it and at what cost. In this sensitivity there are less optimism around finding places to store CO<sub>2</sub> and the costs of storage are assumed to be three times higher than else assumed.

### Restriction on Bioenergy Import - icon: leaf
To represent the limited global bioenergy potential, partly due to sustainability demands, an import bound on bioenergy to the Nordic countries is introduced. With the biofuel import bound, the bioenergy use in the Nordics is restricted to the domestic biomass supply potentials from 2040 onwards. Without the import bound, biomass and biofuels can be imported from the rest of the world at an assumed market price.
